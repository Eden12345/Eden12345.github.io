          <p class="description about-des">From DOS games to digital audio workstations, I’ve been interested in computer software for as long as I can remember. My most recent position was at SoundCloud, where I had the invaluable experience of working on internal tools and user-facing features for Copyright Operations at one of the most disruptive media platforms in the history of music technology.
          <br><br>
          In order to further increase my understanding of the languages and frameworks used in modern web development, I enrolled in App Academy, which I graduated from this past February. You can see some of my most recent projects that demonstrate my skill set on this site, as well as past collaborative projects I made with other developers and designers.</p>
